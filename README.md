## Acknowledgement

This project is inspired by [python-project-template](https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/) and use lots of script from it. I'd like to thank the authors for their great work.

Also, I'd like to thank [cmake-build-extension](https://github.com/diegoferigo/cmake-build-extension/) for their elegant work on CMake and Python integration.

Also thanks [CC](https://github.com/caic99) for helping me with C++ and CMake.
